    "In this notebook I explore the **Kiva Crowdfunding** dataset (`kiva_loans.csv`) using `pandas`.  \n",

    "The analysis:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Filters rows using **string methods** and **numerical conditions**\n",
    "- Sorts tables with `.sort_values`\n",
    "- Aggregates data with `.groupby`\n",
    "- Creates new variables using `.apply` and `lambda`\n",
    "- Explicitly considers that loans are in **different currencies**, using the `currency` column and the `funded_amount` (in USD) as a common basis. :contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}\n",

    "### Interpretation\n",
    "\n",
    "The results show that **Agriculture** is the sector with the highest total amount funded on Kiva, followed closely by **Food** and **Retail**. These sectors also have the highest number of loans, which indicates that the large total funding volume is driven primarily by the **high frequency of loans**, rather than unusually large individual loan sizes.\n",
    "\n",
    "The **median funded amount** across the top sectors remains relatively similar (between 400 and 500 USD), suggesting that Kiva loan sizes tend to be fairly consistent across different economic activities. Therefore, what distinguishes the leading sectors is not the size of each loan, but the **scale of activity** and the number of borrowers involved.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "Agriculture, Food and Retail dominate Kiva’s portfolio in terms of total funding and number of loans. These sectors receive the greatest share of resources because they represent a large portion of the microfinance demand, rather than because they have significantly higher individual loan values.\n"

    "### Interpretation\n",
    "\n",
    "The results reveal substantial variation in typical loan sizes across different currencies, even after converting all values to an approximate USD equivalent using the `loan_amount_usd` variable. Some currencies, often used in countries with higher living costs or larger microfinance operations, show **higher mean and median loan sizes**, while others are associated with significantly smaller loans.\n",
    "\n",
    "The currencies at the top of the ranking tend to have both:\n",
    "- **higher average loan amounts**,  \n",
    "- **higher medians**,  \n",
    "\n",
    "indicating that larger loans are common within those monetary contexts. Conversely, currencies near the bottom show relatively low median and mean values, suggesting that Kiva loans in those economies are typically small-scale interventions.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is also important to note that this ranking reflects not only economic differences between countries, but also the **operational practices of Kiva’s field partners**, who adapt loan sizes to local needs, costs and repayment capacities.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "Loan sizes differ substantially across currencies, even after standardizing values to USD. This confirms that the **currency of the loan is strongly associated with the loan’s purchasing power, local economic conditions and microfinance structure** in each region. The analysis highlights how Kiva’s global operations adjust to diverse financial environments around the world.\n"

    "\n",
    "This table shows, for each *(country, currency)* pair in food–related loans, how many loans were funded and what the median loan size is in USD terms.  \n",
    "To reduce noise, only combinations with at least 100 loans were kept.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can see that some countries, such as **United States (USD)** and **Paraguay (PYG)**, have relatively high median loan sizes for food–related activities, often above 3,000–5,000 USD. This suggests that Kiva loans linked to food in those contexts tend to support **larger projects or higher-cost activities**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Other countries in the list have lower median loan amounts (around a few hundred to a couple of thousand USD), indicating that food–related loans there are typically **smaller scale interventions**, even though the number of loans can still be substantial.\n",
    "\n",
    "The distribution across different currencies also highlights how food–related microfinance adapts to local economic conditions: the same “type” of sector (Food) can correspond to very different funding scales depending on the country and currency.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "Food-related loans on Kiva are not homogeneous across countries. Some countries and currencies are associated with **significantly larger median loan sizes**, while others mainly receive smaller loans. This shows that Kiva’s support to the food sector is strongly shaped by the local economic context and by how field partners structure their lending activities in each country.\n"

    "The results show clear differences in loan size across borrower gender compositions.  \n",

    "\n",
    "Female borrowers, while accounting for the **largest number of loans** by far, receive loans with the **lowest median value** (around 425 USD). This pattern is consistent with microfinance practices worldwide, where women are more frequent loan recipients but often take smaller, more targeted loans aimed at small enterprises, household activities or livelihood support.\n",
    "\n",
    "The category **“N/A”** corresponds to missing or unusual gender entries (e.g., loans where borrower_genders is empty or not specified). These loans display median values between those of male and female categories.\n",

    "### Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "Borrower gender composition is clearly associated with differences in loan size on Kiva. Mixed–gender groups receive the largest loans, male borrowers receive moderately higher amounts, and female borrowers—despite representing the majority of borrowers—typically receive smaller individual loan amounts. This reflects both operational practices of field partners and broader global patterns in microfinance lending.\n"

    "The results show how Kiva’s lending activity in the Philippines evolved between 2014 and 2017.  \n",
    "Both indicators — the **number of loans** and the **mean loan amount** in USD — exhibit noticeable patterns over time.\n",
    "\n",
    "The number of loans increases substantially from 2014 to 2016, indicating a period of strong expansion in Kiva’s operations in the country. In 2017, however, the volume decreases again, which may reflect strategic adjustments by field partners, changing demand, or shifts in Kiva’s regional priorities.\n",
    "\n",
    "The **average loan size** remains relatively stable throughout the years, fluctuating only slightly around 314–345 USD. This suggests that, although the number of loans changed over time, the *typical scale* of each individual loan remained consistent. In other words, the growth in total lending activity was driven by **more borrowers being served**, not by larger loans being issued.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "Kiva’s operations in the Philippines show a period of significant growth in the number of loans between 2014 and 2016, followed by a decline in 2017, while the mean loan size stays stable across all years. This indicates that temporal variation in lending activity is primarily driven by changes in borrower volume rather than changes in the size of microloans.\n"

    "### Interpretation\n",
    "\n",
    "By focusing on the top 1% of loans (based on `loan_amount_usd`), we isolate the very largest microloans in the Kiva dataset. These loans are uncommon but highly informative, as they reveal which sectors, currencies and repayment structures are associated with large–scale microfinance operations.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Sector patterns:**  \n",
    "The sector summary shows that the largest loans tend to concentrate in a small number of categories, such as *Agriculture*, *Retail*, *Services*, *Housing* or *Education*. These sectors typically involve larger business activities, higher operating costs or more capital-intensive projects, which explains why they appear so strongly in the top 1%.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Currency patterns:**  \n",
    "The currency distribution indicates which monetary systems are associated with larger loans. Currencies like USD, KES, MXN or PHP often appear at the top because they are used in countries with larger-scale microfinance institutions or in regions where field partners offer higher-value credit products. This highlights how economic context and financial infrastructure influence loan size.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Repayment interval patterns:**  \n",
    "In the repayment summary, certain repayment intervals — such as *monthly* or *irregular* — are more common among the largest loans. Monthly repayment schedules are typical for structured, business-oriented loans, while irregular schedules may be linked to seasonal or agriculture-based activities. This suggests that repayment structure is also adapted to the type and scale of the project being financed.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "The largest 1% of Kiva loans are not randomly distributed: they cluster within specific sectors, currencies and repayment structures. These large loans tend to support more capital-intensive activities and reflect the operational strategies of Kiva’s field partners in regions where higher-value microfinance is feasible. Overall, this analysis reveals how very large loans differ from typical microloans in both economic context and project characteristics.\n"

    "# Final Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "This exploratory analysis of the Kiva Crowdfunding dataset reveals how microfinance activity varies across sectors, countries, currencies, borrower profiles and time.  \n",
    "By addressing six analytical questions, we were able to uncover consistent structural patterns in Kiva’s global loan portfolio while practising core data-handling techniques in pandas.\n",
    "\n",
    "Throughout the notebook, we applied all required operations:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Row filtering** using string methods (`str.contains`) and numerical conditions.  \n",
    "- **Sorting** using `sort_values`.  \n",
    "- **Grouping and aggregation** with `groupby`.  \n",
    "- **Creation of new variables** using `apply` and `lambda`, including the standardized `loan_amount_usd` and the `borrower_type` classification.  \n",
    "- **Currency-adjusted comparison**, ensuring fair analysis of loan sizes across countries.\n",
    "\n",
    "The results highlight several important insights:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Sector trends:** Agriculture, Food and Retail dominate both in total funding and loan volume, indicating large demand and extensive field-partner activity in these areas.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Currency differences:** Even after converting to USD, loan sizes differ sharply across currencies, reflecting local economic environments and lending strategies.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Food-related loans:** Food-sector lending varies widely across countries, with some markets supporting significantly larger loan sizes than others.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Borrower gender:** Mixed-gender groups and male borrowers tend to receive larger loans, while women represent the majority of borrowers but typically receive smaller individual loan amounts—consistent with global microfinance patterns.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Temporal dynamics:** In high-volume countries such as the Philippines, Kiva’s activity expanded significantly over time, driven primarily by an increase in the number of loans rather than changes in loan size.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Largest 1% of loans:** Very large loans cluster in specific sectors, currencies and repayment structures, showing how capital-intensive projects and stable financial ecosystems influence the scale of lending.\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, this analysis demonstrates how Kiva adapts its lending practices to local economic conditions, borrower characteristics and field-partner strategies.  \n",
    "Despite being a single dataset, the diversity of patterns illustrates how microfinance can vary dramatically across regions and contexts.\n",
    "\n",
    "The exercise also showed the importance of cleaning, transforming and standardizing data—particularly when working with multiple currencies—so that meaningful comparisons and insights can be drawn.  \n",
    "By combining pandas operations with contextual interpretation, we gain a comprehensive understanding of how Kiva allocates resources and supports borrowers worldwide.\n"
